## The Challenge (https://github.com/github/game-off-2012)

Create a **web-based** game *loosely* built around one or more of the following themes:

* forking (or forks)
* branching (or branches)
* cloning (or clones)
* pushing
* pulling


## The outcome

Unfortunately the game currently sucks since I've had too little time to finish it.
